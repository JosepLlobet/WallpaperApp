# Wallpaper App
Hi, this is a linux (tested on manjaro) application that download a random video from the webside "https://www.desktophut.com/category/anime-live-wallpapers" directly to your computer and sets it as wallpaper automatically.

## Needed
```console
sudo pacman install xwinwrap
sudo pacman install wmctrl  
```
xwinwrap will set the video as wallpaper
wmctrl will give us the id of our desktop (Already installed in Manjaro GNOME)
