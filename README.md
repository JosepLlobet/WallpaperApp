# Wallpaper App
Hi, this is a linux (tested on Manjaro GNOME) application that download a random video from the webside "https://www.desktophut.com/category/anime-live-wallpapers" directly to your computer and sets it as wallpaper automatically.

It is focused on downloading Anime Wallpapers, but only depends on the Webside. So you can modify URL to download another Category...

## Needed ARCH LINUX
```console
sudo pacman install xwinwrap
```
xwinwrap will set the video as wallpaper
