# Wallpaper App
Hi, this is a linux (tested on manjaro) application that download a random video from the webside "https://www.desktophut.com/category/anime-live-wallpapers" directly to your computer and sets it as wallpaper automatically.

It is focused on downloading Anime Wallpapers, but only depends on the Webside.

## Needed
```console
sudo pacman install xwinwrap
```
xwinwrap will set the video as wallpaper
